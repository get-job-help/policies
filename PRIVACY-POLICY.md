# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** September 29, 2025

Your privacy is important to us. Learn how we collect, use, and protect your information.

---

## Information We Collect

We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create an account, update your profile, or contact us for support. This may include your name, email address, phone number, professional experience, and other career-related information.

Additionally, we store data on your behalf as part of our service, including job application materials, career documents, notes, and other content you choose to save within the platform.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and improve our services, including to help you manage your professional profile, track job applications, and provide personalized career guidance.

We may track metrics and perform analysis on the data you store with us to improve the user experience, enhance our services, and help optimize your career outcomes. This analysis is conducted to provide you with better recommendations, insights, and personalized guidance tailored to your professional goals.

## Information Sharing

As a matter of policy, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent.

We may share your information with trusted service providers who assist us in operating our platform, such as payment providers and security services. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the purposes we specify.

When you choose to engage with features that involve sharing your information—such as working with career coaches or connecting with other professionals—we will seek your explicit consent before any information is shared. You will always be clearly informed when a feature requires sharing your data with third parties, and you have full control over whether to proceed.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

We work to deploy and achieve platforms that comply with industry-leading security standards including SOC 2, NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), and PCI DSS. We leverage modern, secure platforms and maintain a team with deep security knowledge to do everything we can to protect your information. Our commitment to security is ongoing, and we continuously monitor and improve our security practices to ensure your data remains safe.

## Your Rights

You have the right and power to access, update, or delete your personal information. You may also opt out of certain communications from us. To exercise these rights, visit the "Controls" section of the app where you have full control over your data and privacy settings.

## System Logging and Telemetry

The function of the app relies on logging and telemetry relating to your account for operational purposes, security monitoring, and service improvement. This system data is not available for exploration or deletion as it is essential for the app's functionality. However, this logging has been specifically optimized to not contain any of your private data, ensuring your personal information remains protected while allowing us to maintain a reliable and secure service.

## Artificial Intelligence and Data Processing

All content on the platform is tagged as created by the entity that created it. Anything created for you by AI or one of our coaches will be clearly marked, ensuring full transparency about the source of content.

When we use AI directly for analysis or content generation, the choice to do so will be clear in the interface. We use hosted AI models, meaning your data is never used outside our platform ecosystem and is not shared with external AI providers for training or other purposes.

In some cases, we may use AI independently to analyze data for platform improvement or as a first analysis of possible violations of our Terms of Service. These internal uses help us maintain service quality and safety while keeping your data within our secure environment.

## Cookies and Browser Storage

We do not use cookies on this main website. Within the GetJobHelp app, we use a combination of cookies and browser storage that are fundamental to the operation and development of the app, such as maintaining your login session and app preferences. We do not integrate any tracking cookies or tracking software where we do not have full control over what happens with your data. All cookies and storage used in the app are under our direct control and follow our privacy principles.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The most recent version of the policy will always appear on this site at this URL. We publicly track all changes to this policy, which can be viewed in our [change log](https://github.com/get-job-help/policies/commits/adopted/PRIVACY-POLICY.md) for full transparency. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
