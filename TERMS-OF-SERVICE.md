## Your Content and Data

You retain full ownership of all intellectual property rights in the content and data you submit to our service. This includes your resumes, cover letters, job applications, notes, and any other materials you create or store on the platform.

By using our service, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to store, process, and display your content solely for the purpose of providing and improving the service to you. This license terminates when you delete your content or close your account, except where retention is required for legal or operational purposes as described in our Privacy Policy.

You agree to use GetJobHelp in a lawful and respectful manner. Specifically, you may not:

- use the service for any unlawful purpose or to solicit others to perform unlawful acts

## Service Availability and Modifications

We work to maintain reliable service availability, but we reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the service at any time. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of material changes that affect your use of the service. We are not liable for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the service, except as required by applicable law.

## Data Backup and Responsibility

While we implement appropriate backup and recovery systems, you are responsible for maintaining your own backup copies of critical data. We encourage you to regularly export and save copies of important documents and information stored in the platform.

## Limitation of Liability

GetJobHelp is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, GetJobHelp and its suppliers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of data, loss of profits, or business interruption, arising out of or related to your use or inability to use the service.

Nothing in these terms excludes or limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

## Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have violated these terms or engaged in conduct that we deem inappropriate or harmful to the service or other users. Upon termination, your right to use the service will immediately cease, though provisions regarding ownership, liability limitations, and dispute resolution will survive termination.

You may terminate your account at any time through the account settings in the application. Upon termination, you may export your data as described in our Privacy Policy.

## Changes to Terms

We may update these terms of service from time to time. The most recent version will always appear on this site at this URL. We publicly track all changes to these terms, which can be viewed in our [change log](#) for full transparency.

If we make material changes to these terms, we will provide at least 30 days notice before the new terms take effect. Your continued use of the service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

## Governing Law and Disputes

These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising from these terms or your use of the service should first be addressed by contacting us at legal@getjobhelp.com to seek an informal resolution.
