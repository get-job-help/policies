# Privacy Canary

**Last updated:** September 29, 2025

---

## Purpose

This Privacy Canary exists to inform users about legal requests we have **not** received. We are committed to transparency regarding government and legal requests for user data.

## What This Document Means

As of the date above, GetJobHelp has **NOT** received any of the following:

- National Security Letters (NSLs)
- FISA court orders
- Gag orders preventing us from discussing legal requests
- Warrants requiring us to log or monitor specific user activities
- Requests to install surveillance software or hardware
- Requests to provide encryption keys or compromise user security
- Requests from foreign governments for user data
- Requests from United States federal agencies for user data
- Requests from United States state or local law enforcement for user data
- Requests from private entities compelling disclosure through litigation

## How to Read This Canary

**If any entity listed above compels us to provide information AND compels our silence about that request, we will remove that entity from this list.**

Changes to this document are tracked in our public [change log](https://github.com/get-job-help/policies/commits/adopted/CANARY.md). If an entity disappears from the list above, it means we have received a request from that type of authority and are legally prevented from discussing it.

We will update this canary quarterly, and the "Last updated" date will reflect our most recent review.

## Important Notes

- We cannot add information about requests after receiving a gag order
- Absence of an update by the expected quarterly date may itself be significant
- We reserve the right to challenge any gag order or warrant we believe to be unconstitutional or overbroad
- Standard legal requests without gag orders (such as properly served subpoenas) may be disclosed in transparency reports separate from this canary

## Verification

This document is version controlled in our public GitHub repository. Users are encouraged to monitor the commit history for any changes.
