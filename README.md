# GetJobHelp Policy Repository

This repository contains the official legal policies for GetJobHelp, maintained with full transparency and version control.

## Purpose

We believe that legal policies should be transparent, trackable, and accessible. By maintaining our policies in a public GitHub repository, we provide:

- **Complete transparency** - Every change to our policies is publicly visible
- **Historical tracking** - Full commit history shows exactly when and how policies evolved
- **User empowerment** - Users can monitor changes, review history, and understand policy development
- **Accountability** - Public version control creates a permanent, immutable record of our commitments

## Repository Contents

- **[PRIVACY-POLICY.md](PRIVACY-POLICY.md)** - Our privacy policy detailing how we collect, use, and protect user information
- **[TERMS-OF-SERVICE.md](TERMS-OF-SERVICE.md)** - Terms governing the use of GetJobHelp services
- **[CANARY.md](CANARY.md)** - Privacy canary documenting legal requests we have NOT received

## Branch Structure

This repository uses three branches to provide transparency for our formal policy process:

- **`under-consideration`** - Proposed policy changes under review and discussion
- **`finalized`** - Policies that have been reviewed and approved, awaiting adoption
- **`adopted`** - Currently active policies displayed on our website

This branching strategy ensures that all policy changes go through a clear, trackable process before becoming official.

## How to Use This Repository

### Viewing Current Policies
Simply open any policy file to read the current version.

### Tracking Changes
Each policy includes a link to its commit history (change log). You can also:
- Watch this repository for notifications of changes
- Review the commit history for any file to see all modifications
- Compare versions to understand exactly what changed

### Privacy Canary
Our privacy canary lists authorities that have NOT compelled us to disclose user information. If an entity is removed from the canary, it indicates we received a request from that authority and are legally prevented from discussing it. Monitor the [CANARY.md commit history](https://github.com/get-job-help/policies/commits/adopted/CANARY.md) for changes.

## Policy Updates

We update policies as needed to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or user feedback. Material changes are:
- Committed to this repository with clear commit messages
- Reflected in the "Last updated" date within each policy
- Announced to users through appropriate channels

## Contact

Questions, concerns, or requests regarding our policies can be sent to **legal@getjobhelp.com**.

*This approach to policy management is inspired by transparency best practices in the technology industry, treating legal documents with the same rigor and openness as open-source code.*
